# Bone Strength in the Diversity Outbred

Project code and analyses


Go to [doc/analysis_pipeline.md](/doc/analysis_pipeline.md) for the analysis pipeline.



Folders are as follows:

    - /bin/ contains scripts that I got from other people

    - /data/contains raw data. For the most part, this is a read-only file (some exceptions)

        - /data/GIGAMUGA/ contains raw data pertaining to the GigaMUGA genotyping. Some writing has been done to this

        - /data/pheno_data/ contains phenotypic data files

    - /doc/ contains docs. Refer to the analysis pipeline here.

    - /results/ contains output from the analyses described. A bit messy but:

        - /results/flat/ contains flat file outputs (.txt, .csv, etc)

        - /results/GIGAMUGA/ contains output pertaining to the genotyping

        - /results/Rdata contains .Rdata and .Rds output
